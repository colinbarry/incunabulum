# Incunabulum: An implementation of J

> One summer weekend in 1989, Arthur Whitney visited Ken Iverson at Kiln Farm and produced — on one page and in one afternoon — an interpreter fragment on the AT&T 3B1 computer. I studied this interpreter for about a week for its organization and programming style; and on Sunday, August 27, 1989, at about four o'clock in the afternoon, wrote the first line of code that became the implementation described in this document.

(I'm not sure who the "I" is in the above quote.)

This is an effort to get Arthur's one-page interpreter building and running on a
modern system.
